One of the early coding assignments in Harvey Mudd's Intro Computer Science is implementing "Rock, Paper, Scissors" in Python. After helping some students debug theirs as a tutor, I realized it could be fun to scrape together a quick Java implementation of "Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock" for two reasons:

- to force myself to write some Java (even for something tiny)
- to practice using IntelliJ
